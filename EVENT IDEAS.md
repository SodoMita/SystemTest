**The Council stops.**

**Maura** stands, kicking her chair back. It clatters—loud, real, physical.

"No. This is wrong. All of it."

**Melody**: "What?"

**Maura**: "Mirror chambers. Breathing walls. Organic tunnels. That's *amusement park* horror. That's 'ooh spooky' with no stakes. You know why it's scary? Because it could happen to *you*. Because someone *chose* it."

**Kaelen**: "You want the horror to be accountable."

**Maura**: "I want the horror to be **responsible**. A breathing wall is just set dressing. A wall that collapsed because someone **skipped inspection** to save money? That's a story. That's a *crime*."

---

## **THE PROBLEM WITH SURREALISM**

**Carmack**: "She's right. Surrealism removes agency. If reality is unreliable, my choices don't matter. 'Oh, the corridor changed? Couldn't have predicted that.' No consequence. No learning."

**Jax**: "But if the corridor floods because *I* didn't fix the seal? That's my fault. I own that death."

**Rita**: "And I remember it. Next run, I fix the seal. I *learned*. The game taught me through consequence, not cheap surprise."

**Barnaby**: "Surrealism is the GM cheating. 'A monster appears!' Why? 'Because I said so.' That's lazy."

**Finch**: "Procedural horror is *earned* horror. The monster appears because *we* made noise. Because *we* neglected maintenance. Because *we* chose speed over safety."

## **LORE vs. GAMEPLAY: THE SEPARATION**

**Kaelen draws a hard line on the table:**

```
LORE                           |  GAMEPLAY
(did happen, can't change)     |  (happening now, you control)
-------------------------------|---------------------------
History                        |  Present
Documents                      |  Decisions
Corruption                     |  Survival
Corporate memos                |  Your choices
Dead people's mistakes         |  Your mistakes
THE SETUP                      |  THE GAME
```

**Kaelen**: "Lore is *archaeology*. You dig up what went wrong before you arrived. It explains *why* the Caisson is dangerous. But it doesn't change *your* situation. You still have to fix the seal or drown."

**Maura**: "The horror in lore is: 'They knew. Someone signed a paper. Someone chose profit over safety.' The horror in gameplay is: 'I'm making the same choice right now.'"

---

## **REDESIGNING SET PIECES: AGENCY-FIRST**

**Carmack**: "Every set piece must answer: What can the player DO here? What are they responsible FOR?"

### **1. THE SAFETY WAIVER WALL**
*A bulletin board. 40 framed documents. Each a signed waiver.*

**Finch**: "Workers signed away their rights. 'I acknowledge the risks.' But read the dates—these were signed *after* the first deaths. Management made survivors sign to keep working."

**Gameplay Function**: Contains **clues about which systems are most dangerous**. A waiver about "venting procedures" tells players: watch the vents.

**Player Agency**: You can **take a waiver** as evidence. But removing it leaves a hole—someone notices. The Saboteur knows you're investigating.

---

### **2. THE PRESSURE TEST LOG**
*A manual logbook. Handwritten entries.*

**Barnaby**: "Engineers testing hull integrity. Each page: date, section, result. 'Section 7: FAILED at 3000m.' 'Section 7: RETEST - PASSED (barely).' 'Section 7: APPROVED for service.'"

**Gameplay Function**: Tells players **which sections are weakest**. Section 7 is a death trap—but it's also the fastest route.

**Player Agency**: You can **trust the log** (avoid Section 7) or **distrust it** (maybe the engineer lied). Your call. Your funeral.

---

### **3. THE OVERTIME LEDGER**
*Pay records. Hours worked. Names.*

**Glitch**: "One engineer worked 96 hours straight before the incident. Same engineer signed off on the beacon installation. Same engineer is now a Dredger in Section 3."

**Gameplay Function**: Explains **why** a Dredger exists—it used to be Frank. But doesn't change the fact that it's trying to kill you.

**Player Agency**: You can **check the ledger** to learn Dredger locations (they haunt their old workplaces). Or skip it and fight blind.

---

### **4. THE BUDGET CUT MEMOS**
*A filing cabinet. Corporate correspondence.*

**Rita**: "'Per your request, we've reduced safety inspection frequency from weekly to monthly. Projected savings: $340,000 annually.' Below that, handwritten: 'Tell the families it was an accident.'"

**Gameplay Function**: **Context, not excuse.** The danger is real because someone chose to make it dangerous. Not magic. Money.

**Player Agency**: None directly. But knowing *why* makes the horror political. You're not just surviving—you're surviving *capitalism*.

---

### **5. THE RECALCULATION TERMINAL**
*A working computer. Life support calculator.*

**Jax**: "Input: current oxygen, current crew. Output: hours remaining. But there's a second field: 'RECALCULATE WITH REDUCED CREW.' It shows how much longer you'd survive if... someone wasn't there."

**Gameplay Function**: **Temptation as mechanic.** The game hands you the math. It doesn't tell you to kill. It just shows you the numbers.

**Player Agency**: You can **close the terminal** and find another way. Or you can **start planning**. The game didn't make you a monster. You chose.

---

### **6. THE EMERGENCY LOCKER**
*One locker. Locked from the inside.*

**Mo**: "Inside: a body. A warning note. A key to the armory. Someone hid from the evac team. They had information. They chose to die rather than be 'rescued.'"

**Gameplay Function**: **Choice with weight.** Take the key, you get weapons. But you also desecrate a grave. Some players will refuse. That's roleplay. That's agency.

**Player Agency**: Leave it alone? Take it? The note warns: "The rescue ship isn't coming. They never sent it." Is that true? Do you trust a corpse?

---

### **7. THE CONTAINMENT BREACH RECORDS**
*Security logs. Timestamped entries.*

**Melody**: "'0347: Containment breach, Section 12.' '0352: Section 12 sealed.' '0415: Noise reported inside Section 12.' '0420: Sealed.' '0433: Noise reported inside Section 12.' They sealed something in. It's still there."

**Gameplay Function**: **Warning, not encounter.** You might never go to Section 12. But you know what's there. The dread is optional—you choose whether to investigate.

**Player Agency**: The door is sealed. You can **unseal it** (contains valuable salvage) or **leave it** (safer). Your choice. Your consequence.

---

## **LORE AS DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE**

**Maura**: "Lore isn't a story we tell. It's **evidence** of a crime scene. Players are detectives, not protagonists. The story already happened. They're just surviving the aftermath."

### **Lore Document Types:**

**PROCUREMENT RECORDS**
- What was bought
- What was *not* bought (safety equipment denied)
- Who approved/denied

**MAINTENANCE LOGS**
- What was fixed
- What was "deferred"
- Who signed off

**COMMUNICATIONS**
- Corporate to site (pressures, threats)
- Site to corporate (warnings, pleas)
- Personal (goodbye letters, confessions)

**INCIDENT REPORTS**
- What went wrong
- Official explanation
- Handwritten corrections ("BULLSHIT" in margins)

**REGULATORY FILINGS**
- What they told inspectors
- What they hid
- Which inspector was "accommodated"

---

## **THE FUNCTION OF HORROR**

**Kaelen**: "Horror has a job. It's not just scaring players—it's **teaching** them. Every scare is information:
- Where is dangerous?
- What causes attention?
- What can I prevent?"

**Rita**: "A Dredger isn't scary because it's ugly. It's scary because it **was preventable**. Someone skipped maintenance. Someone ignored a warning. And now it's here."

**Jax**: "And if *I* skip maintenance? *I* create the next Dredger. That's horror. I'm not a victim. I'm a participant."

---

## **REVISED SET PIECE PRINCIPLES**

**Carmack**: "New rules:

1. **No random surrealism**. Everything has a cause. Everything could have been prevented (by someone, sometime).

2. **Lore is archaeology**. Players dig up what went wrong. They can't change it. They can only learn from it.

3. **Gameplay is choice**. Players make decisions NOW that have consequences LATER. No 'a monster appears.' Only 'a monster appears BECAUSE...'

4. **Responsibility is horror**. The scariest thing isn't 'it's after me.' It's 'I caused this.'

5. **Documentation is truth**. The horror is in the paperwork. The signatures. The approvals. Real people made real choices."

---

## **EXAMPLE: THE FLOODED SECTION**

**OLD VERSION**: "Spooky organic tunnel with breathing walls."

**NEW VERSION**:

*Section 7 is flooded. Why? Check the logs:*

- **Maintenance Report, Day 45**: "Seal showing fatigue. Recommend replacement."
- **Budget Response, Day 46**: "Denied. Cost exceeds Q3 allowance."
- **Maintenance Report, Day 52**: "Seal critical. THIS WILL FAIL."
- **No response.**
- **Incident Report, Day 58**: "Seal failure. Section 7 flooded. 4 casualties."
- **Internal Memo, Day 59**: "Crew quarters in Section 7 are now 'offline.' Notify families: 'tragic accident.'"

**Gameplay**: Section 7 is dangerous because **water pressure is real**. The breach is there because **someone denied a repair**. Players can **avoid Section 7** (learn from history) or **risk it** (faster route).

**Agency**: If players neglect OTHER seals, OTHER sections flood. They become the new authors of tragedy.

---

## **EXAMPLE: THE DREDGER**

**OLD VERSION**: "Spooky robot monster that wants to kill you."

**NEW VERSION**:

*Dredger Unit 7 used to be Maintenance Tech Kowalski. Check personnel file:*

- **Assigned**: 12-hour shifts
- **Actual**: 72-hour shifts (check overtime ledger)
- **Incident**: "Exposed to hydraulic fluid. Personality changes noted."
- **Medical Log**: "Refused treatment. Said he 'had to finish the job.'"
- **Final Entry**: "Kowalski locked in maintenance bay. No longer responds to name. Continuing routine. DO NOT APPROACH."

**Gameplay**: Dredger 7 patrols the maintenance bay. It's performing its old job—forever. It attacks because you're "in the way" of its routine. Not evil. Just broken.

**Agency**: Players can **distract it** with maintenance tasks (it stops to "help"). Or **destroy it** (but it drops Kowalski's ID badge—a real person existed here).

---

## **THE COUNCIL'S REVISED VERDICT**

**Maura**: "This is horror for adults. Horror with paperwork. Horror where the monster isn't evil—it's the *result* of evil."

**Kaelen**: "And the player isn't innocent. They make the same choices. Speed vs. safety. Individual vs. group. Now vs. later."

**Carmack**: "Implementable. Documents are text files. Logs are simple databases. No complex systems—just readable evidence."

**Melody**: "And every death is a new document. 'Player X died in Section 7. Cause: seal failure. Note: Player X skipped seal inspection 3 turns earlier.'"

**Rita**: "The game writes its own horror. You document your own tragedy."

**Barnaby** looks at the depth gauge: **-2856m**

**Barnaby**: "We're still sinking. And I have to ask... who didn't fix the ballast tanks?"

**No one answers.**

**Because they all know.**

**Someone in this room made a choice.**
